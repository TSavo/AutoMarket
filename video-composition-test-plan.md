# Video Composition System - Manual Test Plan

## Test Environment Setup
1. Ensure the development server is running: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to `/composition-editor` in your browser
3. Verify that the composition editor loads without errors

## Phase 1: Asset Loading Tests

### Test 1.1: Basic Asset Loading âœ…
- **Expected**: Content, intro, outro, and overlay assets load successfully
- **Steps**:
  1. Open composition editor
  2. Verify that asset cards appear in each section
  3. Check that thumbnails display correctly
  4. Verify that asset metadata (duration, resolution) is shown

### Test 1.2: Error Recovery âœ…
- **Expected**: Error recovery system works when assets fail to load
- **Steps**:
  1. Temporarily break the asset API (rename `/api/media/assets.ts`)
  2. Refresh the composition editor
  3. Verify error alert appears with retry button
  4. Restore the API file
  5. Click retry button
  6. Verify assets load successfully

## Phase 2: Composition Creation Tests

### Test 2.1: Basic Composition âœ…
- **Expected**: Can create a simple composition with content video only
- **Steps**:
  1. Enter title: "Test Composition"
  2. Enter description: "Testing basic composition functionality"
  3. Select a content video
  4. Click "Create Composition"
  5. Verify progress tracking appears
  6. Wait for completion notification

### Test 2.2: Full Composition âœ…
- **Expected**: Can create composition with intro, content, outro, and overlays
- **Steps**:
  1. Enter title: "Full Test Composition"
  2. Select content video
  3. Expand "Intro Video" section and select an intro
  4. Expand "Outro Video" section and select an outro
  5. Expand "Overlay Videos" section and add an overlay
  6. Configure overlay positioning and timing
  7. Adjust crossfade duration
  8. Click "Create Composition"
  9. Monitor progress and verify completion

## Phase 3: Advanced Features Tests

### Test 3.1: Overlay Positioning âœ…
- **Expected**: Overlay positioning preview works correctly
- **Steps**:
  1. Add an overlay to a composition
  2. Click "Configure" on the overlay
  3. Verify positioning preview shows content + overlay
  4. Drag overlay to different positions
  5. Verify position coordinates update
  6. Save configuration

### Test 3.2: Progress Tracking âœ…
- **Expected**: Real-time progress tracking during composition
- **Steps**:
  1. Create a composition with multiple videos
  2. Monitor progress bar during processing
  3. Verify progress percentage increases
  4. Verify ETA calculations appear
  5. Verify completion notification

### Test 3.3: Hardware Acceleration âœ…
- **Expected**: Hardware acceleration is detected and used when available
- **Steps**:
  1. Check browser console during composition creation
  2. Look for hardware acceleration detection messages
  3. Verify FFMPEG commands use hardware encoders when available

## Phase 4: Error Handling Tests

### Test 4.1: Invalid Asset Selection âœ…
- **Expected**: Proper validation when required fields are missing
- **Steps**:
  1. Try to create composition without title
  2. Verify validation error appears
  3. Try to create composition without content video
  4. Verify validation error appears

### Test 4.2: FFMPEG Processing Errors âœ…
- **Expected**: Graceful handling of processing failures
- **Steps**:
  1. Create composition with incompatible video formats (if available)
  2. Verify error handling and user notification
  3. Check that system remains stable after error

## Phase 5: Performance Tests

### Test 5.1: Large File Handling âœ…
- **Expected**: System handles large video files efficiently
- **Steps**:
  1. Use video files > 100MB if available
  2. Monitor memory usage during processing
  3. Verify processing completes successfully
  4. Check output quality

### Test 5.2: Concurrent Processing âœ…
- **Expected**: Multiple compositions can be processed
- **Steps**:
  1. Start first composition
  2. Open new tab and start second composition
  3. Verify both process correctly
  4. Check that progress tracking works for both
