Refactor: Remove DockerBackedMediaProviderAdapter and use DockerMediaProvider directly

This commit refactors the dynamic service loading mechanism to remove the intermediate `DockerBackedMediaProviderAdapter` and directly use a new `DockerMediaProvider` class.

- **Removed Adapter**: The `DockerBackedMediaProviderAdapter` class has been deleted.
- **Introduced DockerMediaProvider**: A new `DockerMediaProvider` class has been created. This class directly implements the `MediaProvider` interface and internally manages a `DockerComposeService` instance. This provides a cleaner class hierarchy by avoiding a wrapper.
- **ProviderRegistry Update**: The `ProviderRegistry` has been updated to instantiate and return `DockerMediaProvider` instances for dynamically loaded Docker-based providers.
- **Provider Reversion**: `FFMPEGProvider` and `HuggingFaceDockerProvider` have been reverted to their state before the adapter was introduced. They no longer implement `DockerBackedMediaProvider` and manage their Docker services directly via `ServiceRegistry` when statically configured.
- **Type System Cleanup**: The `DockerBackedMediaProvider` interface has been removed from `src/media/types/provider.ts`.

This change simplifies the architecture and improves the clarity of the class relationships.
