Refactor: Update all Docker-related providers and tests for Docker Compose Only model

This commit finalizes the refactoring of the Docker service management by updating all remaining Docker-related providers and their associated test files.

- **Provider Refactoring**: `ChatterboxProvider`, `KokoroDockerProvider`, `OllamaDockerProvider`, `WhisperDockerProvider`, and `ZonosDockerProvider` have been refactored to align with the 'Docker Compose Only' model. They now obtain their `DockerComposeService` instances from the `ServiceRegistry` and delegate Docker operations to it.
- **Test Updates**: Relevant test files, including `test-dynamic-registries.ts`, `test-github-loading.ts`, `test-provider-service-loading.ts`, and `test-zonos-health.ts`, have been updated to reflect the new architecture and ensure correct interaction with Docker-backed services.
- **Cleanup**: Redundant provider files (e.g., `ChatterboxDockerProvider.ts`) and direct Docker service instantiations in tests have been removed.

This ensures a consistent and clean approach to Docker service management across the entire codebase.
